Black Holes as Regions of Complete Photon Invisibility  
Temporal Freezing and Simultaneous β/α Decay in Saturated Cores

**Key results**
- Black holes = perfect dark disks (no photons escape saturated region)  
- β-decay (10³ s) and α-decay (10⁻²¹ s) become simultaneous → time freezes locally  
- Stellar cores = mini-saturated regions → explain fusion & simultaneous decays  
- “Black stars” = observable intermediate phase (neutron stars with saturated core)
